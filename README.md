# PHYS448_FinalProject_CNN_WaveformDenoising
PHYS448 final project on using CNN model to denoise HPGe detector waveform signals

This repository contains the code and results for a waveform denoising project using High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector data. The goal is to reconstruct clean waveforms from noisy measurements using a customized 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an encoder–decoder architecture.
The project implements the model and training workflows in 
a. Keras
b. TensorFlow
c. PyTorch.
